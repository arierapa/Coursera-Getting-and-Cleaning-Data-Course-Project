# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

# read the train and testing data sets
train<-read.table("X_train.txt")
test<-read.table("X_test.txt")

# merge the training and test data sets into a variabe called (data)
data <- rbind(train, test)


# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

# read the measurements names into the (info) variable
info<-read.table("features.txt")

# asssign the measurements names to the data names
colnames(data)<-info[,2]

# find the mean and the std names 
ndata1<-data[,grep("mean()",names(data),fixed=TRUE)]
ndata2<-data[,grep("std()",names(data),fixed=TRUE)]

# create (ndata) with only the mean and standard deviation of each measurment
ndata<-cbind(ndata1,ndata2)


# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

# read the activity levels and assign to (actlev) variable
actlev<-read.table("activity_labels.txt")


# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

# read the code of the activity of each row and assign to (nrow) variable
nrowt<-read.table("y_train.txt")
nrows<-read.table("y_test.txt")
nrow<-rbind(nrowt,nrows)

# assign the name of the activity to each row according to their respective code
x<-merge(nrow,actlev,by.x="V1",by.y="V1",all=TRUE,sort=FALSE)

# create the variable (activity) in the data set and assigne the name of each activity
data$activity<-x[,2]


# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#read the subject code of each row
subtrain<-read.table("subject_train.txt")
subtest<-read.table("subject_test.txt")
subj<-rbind(subtrain,subtest)

# create the variable (subject) in the data set and assign the respective subject
data$subject<-subj[,1]

# create the independet tidy data set(tdata) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
library(plyr)
tdata<-aggregate(. ~subject + activity, data, mean)

# create the (tdata.txt) file from the tidy data set
write.table(tdata,file="tdata.txt",row.name=FALSE)
